Sunny Shah Homework 4 CS283 


Within a subdirectory, you have several files some of which (with an extension .txt)
are plain text. Your program should do the following
Search within each of these files for a string specified as the first parameter,
for example abcde.
If the file does contain the string (abcde), the program should replace the
string everywhere with another string specified as the second parameter, for
example xyz.
If the first string (abcde) does not exist within the file, the program should
insert it (abcde) immediately before a string specified as a third parameter,
for example pqrst.
If the third string (pqrst) does not exist, your program should do nothing.
Be particularly careful about replacing strings of different lengths; make sure to
allocate additional memory if needed!
Print a log of your program's activities to stdout.

1. Compile C code 
	-make build 
2. run target 
	-Please give the DIR1=(the path you are looking in) arg1 =(the first search arg) arg2= (the one to replace it with) and arg3=(the one to put arg1 infront of)
3. A log will be printed to stdout
