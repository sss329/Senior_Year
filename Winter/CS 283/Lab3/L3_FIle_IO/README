 *  Given two directories ./a and ./b, passed as parameters to your program, you are     *
 *  to synchronize them, as follows:                                                     *
 *	-If a file in a does not exist in b, you should replicate it in b.               *
 *	-If a file in b does not exist in a, it should be deleted from b.                *
 *	-If a file exists in both a and b, the file with the most recent modified date / *
 *	 time should be copied from one directory to the other.                          *
 *  Print a log of your program's activities to stdout or stderr.                        *

1. compile C code 
	- make build 
2. run sync of directories 
	-Please use DIR1=a DIR2=b make sync as a build target.
3. A log will be printed to stdout of program activites
